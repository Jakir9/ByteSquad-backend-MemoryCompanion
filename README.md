## About

Memory Companion is a user-friendly application designed to support individuals suffering from dementia and other memory-related conditions. Our app aims to provide a centralized platform for storing memories, visual and audio prompts, and daily activity reminders, tailored to each individual's objectives. By facilitating social care and improving the overall quality of life for those affected by memory loss, our goal is to empower users and enhance their independence.

## Problem Statement

Many individuals suffering from dementia and other conditions struggle to retain memories, follow daily activities, and maintain independence due to memory loss. There is a need for a user-friendly application that provides a centralized platform for storing memories, visual and audio prompts, and daily activity reminders, tailored to the individual's objectives. This application should support multiple users, facilitating social care and improving the overall quality of life for those affected by dementia and other conditions.
